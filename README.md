**Hello Sir, **
Here is my prject which is named as "MEDGPT" which provides quick response about any information related to medical field.
A JavaScript-based message queue system that processes user input asynchronously.
It also  integrates real-time AI responses via WebSocket, dynamically updates the chat interface, and stores conversation history using localStorage for persistence.
The use of queue is to ensure sequential processing of user messages.
**THANK YOU.**
